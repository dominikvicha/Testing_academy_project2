- things you can do with the tasks: 
    - add task
    - show task
    - update task
    - delete task

- the second table is created with same structure as the existing one
- there are two main files:
   - main.py - python code
   - test_main.py - testing in python 
  
### Requiremts ###
- You need to install the Testing framework - Pytest.
- The official documentation is here: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/
- MySQL Workbench 

### How to start the tests ###
- Start it by:
- test_main.py
- pytest              (you can see just the "." it means passed.) 
  
- If this doesnt work, make sure you have the right path for the main.py file, for example: pytest  python/python_learning/test_main.py
